This is homework 4, making a quiz using Javascript.  I have the timer and the quiz basically
coded out.

The two functions I am missing are the high scores table and also subtracting time off 
when the user clicks the wrong answer.  I will try and add them tomorrow.  But for now,
this is the most recent version.
